    <h1>A Dream Within A Dream</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
        <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
        And, in parting from you now,<br>
        Thus much let me avow--<br>
        You are not wrong, who deem<br>
        That my days have been a dream;<br>
        Yet if hope has flown away<br>
        In a night, or in a day,<br>
        In a vision, or in none,<br>
        Is it therefore the less gone?<br>
        All that we see or seem<br>
        Is but a dream within a dream.</p>

        <p>I stand amid the roar<br>
        Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
        And I hold within my hand<br>
        Grains of the golden sand--<br>
        How few! yet how they creep<br>
        Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
        While I weep--while I weep!<br>
        O God! can I not grasp<br>
        Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
        O God! can I not save<br>
        One from the pitiless wave?<br>
        Is all that we see or seem<br>
        But a dream within a dream?</p>
